# Overrides Hyrax app/actors/hyrax/actors/add_to_work_actor.rb

# When a user edits parent work relationships, the edit form will display a list of the work's current parents, each with a button to remove the relationship. Additional parents can be added to the list by using a search box.
# ENV attributes passed to the actor include a hash of works to keep, add, or remove as parents of the current work. The works may or may not already be parents of the current work.
# The parent relationship is recorded on the parent work; the current work's id will be added or removed from the parent's children as required. The current work will not be changed.
# If a work is already a parent and has destroy 'false' OR if a work is not already a parent and has 'destroy' true, those works will not be processed.
# Example:
# "work_parents_attributes"=>
#   {
#     "0"=>{"id"=>"nk322d32h", "_destroy"=>"false"},  ( <-- previously added parent )
#     "1"=>{"id"=>"db78tc01m", "_destroy"=>"true"},   ( <-- previously added parent to be removed )
#     "2"=>{"id"=>"bg257f046", "_destroy"=>"false"}   ( <-- new parent to be added )
#   }
