  simple_form:
    labels:
      imaging_event:
        # X-ray CT metadata
    hints:
      imaging_event:
        software: Software used to operate scanner, if any.
        # X-ray CT metadata
        exposure_time: Exposure time of a volume shall be the time of the X-Ray radiation in position with this volume. It depends on the travel speed and the total collimation width.
        flux_normalization: Flux Normalization Calibration
        geometric_calibration: 
        shading_correction: Shading Correction Calibration
        filter_material: Filter (material that xrays must pass through before encounter object and detector and its thickness in millimeters)
        filter_thickness: Filter (material that xrays must pass through before encounter object and detector and its thickness in millimeters)
        frame_averaging: Frame Averaging. The number of images acquired at each projection angle and their average.
        projections: The number of images at distinct angles used to create a 3D image.
        voltage: Voltage, units in kilovolts
        power:  = kV*Amps, units in kilowatts
        amperage: Amperage, units in microAmps
        surrounding_material: Wedge (material surrounding/enveloping the focal object of the scan)
        xray_tube_type: brand/model, reflection vs. transmission target (a little like 'lens type' for photogrammetry)
        target_type: 
        detector_type: The type of detector used to acquire this image.
        detector_configuration: The physical configuration of the detector.
        source_object_distance: Distance between x-ray source and target object.
        source_detector_distance: Distance between x-ray source and x-ray detector.
        target_material: Tungsten, molybdenum, copper, etc.
        rotation_number: For systems with vertical translation capabilities.
        phase_contrast: In phase contrast, the xray beam energy is modulated between higher and lower energies and this helps increase contrast between materials (need to look into implications for reporting voltage and amps)
        optical_magnification: All microCT scanners use geometric magnification.  Only a few also use optical magnification (Ziess/Xradia machines do - which makes them more flexible and powerful in some ways - but more systems may in the future)
        # Photogrammetry properties
        focal_length_type: Focal length variable or fixed
        background_removal: Free text description of background removal methods
        # Photogrammetry properties and Photography properties
        lens_make: The DSLR body would be the 'capture device' while the lens  make/model is designated here.  Not sure if we need to consider whether multiple lens might be used for the same image series.
        lens_model: The DSLR body would be the 'capture device' while the lens  make/model is designated here.  Not sure if we need to consider whether multiple lens might be used for the same image series.
        light_source: Strobe light vs static light vs cross-polarized light vs patterned light
